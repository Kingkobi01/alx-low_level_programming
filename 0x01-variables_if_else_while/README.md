0. [Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative.c)   
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
* The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program
* The output of the program should be:
    * The number, followed by
        * if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
        * if the number is 0: `is zero`
        * if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    * followed by a new line

1. [The last digit](./1-last_digit.c)   
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
* The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program
* The output of the program should be:

    The string `Last digit of`, followed by
    `n`, followed by
    the string `is`, followed by
       * if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
       * if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
       * if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
    * followed by a new line
